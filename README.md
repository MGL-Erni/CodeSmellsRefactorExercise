# Code Smells
### What are Code Smells?

Code Smells are the traces in the code that indicates a deeper problem in the application or codebase. They are not bugs or errors but are tangible and observable violations of code design/development fundamentals that could eventually lead to poor code quality and technical debt. The code will still compile and perform as expected, but it may impede the development process and make the program vulnerable to performance and security issues in the future. Code smells indicate the underlying issues that lead to technical debt.

### Common Code Smells
1. Long Methods:
     Methods that are excessively long and perform too many tasks can be hard to understand and maintain. Break down lengthy methods into smaller, more focused ones to improve readability and maintainability.

2. Large Classes: 
    Classes that have too many responsibilities or too much functionality can become difficult to manage and understand. Consider breaking down large classes into smaller, cohesive ones that adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

3. Inconsistent Naming
    Inconsistent naming conventions can make your code confusing. Adopt a consistent naming style for variables, methods, and classes.

4. Conditional Complexity:
    Complex conditional statements reduce code readability. Simplify conditions and extract them into well-named methods to improve code comprehension.

5. Duplicate Code:
    Duplicate code increases the risk of inconsistencies. Create reusable methods or extract common functionality into separate classes.

6. Comments Overuse:
    Excessive comments can be a sign that your code is not self-explanatory. Aim for self-documenting code by using clear and meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes.

7. Mutable State:
    Frequent changes to object states can introduce bugs and make code harder to reason about. Favor immutability and limit the use of mutable state where possible.

8. Lack of Error Handling:
    Ignoring exceptions or not handling errors gracefully can lead to unpredictable behavior. Always include proper error handling in your code.

9. Tight Coupling:
    Highly coupled code can be challenging to maintain and modify. Aim for loose coupling by using interfaces and dependency injection.

10. Feature Envy:
    Feature envy occurs when a method seems more interested in the data of another class than its own. This may indicate a need for refactoring to improve encapsulation.

11. Data Clumps:
    Data clumps occur when a set of variables or parameters are frequently grouped together. This may indicate that these variables belong to a common abstraction.

12. Inappropriate Intimacy:
Inappropriate intimacy occurs when classes are tightly coupled and have access to each otherâ€™s internal details. This can make the code more fragile and harder to maintain.
